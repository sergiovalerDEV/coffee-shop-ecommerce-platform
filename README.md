🍔 Fast Food E-commerce API
📜 Project Description
The Fast Food E-commerce API is a RESTful API built with JavaScript that enables online ordering of fast food. 🍕 This project utilizes a hexagonal architecture to promote clean code, testability, and easy maintenance. 🔧 The API is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for scalability and reliability. ☁️

🌟 Features
User authentication and authorization 🔐
Secure login and registration for users.

Menu management (CRUD operations) 📋
Create, Read, Update, and Delete food items in the menu.

Order processing 🛍️
Handle order creation, updates, and status tracking.

Payment integration 💳
Process payments securely through integrated payment gateways.

Real-time order tracking ⏱️
Track the status of orders in real-time.

Responsive API 📱💻
Designed for seamless interaction with both mobile and web applications.

🏗️ Architecture
The API follows a client-server architecture using JavaScript with Node.js and Express. This design enables a clear separation of concerns between the client-side (frontend) and server-side (backend) applications. 🔄

Key Components:
Client: The frontend application that interacts with users, sending requests to the server and displaying responses. It can be a web app, mobile app, or any other interface. 📱💻

Server: The backend application built with Node.js and Express, responsible for processing incoming requests, accessing the database, and returning responses to the client. ⚙️

Database: PostgreSQL is used for storing user and order data, ensuring reliable data management. 🗄️

API Endpoints: The server exposes various RESTful API endpoints that the client can interact with to perform operations like authentication, menu management, and order processing. 📡

Middleware: Express middleware functions handle requests and responses, adding functionality such as logging, authentication, and error handling. 🛠️

🛠️ Technologies Used
JavaScript (Node.js): Programming language for API development. 🌐

Express.js: Web application framework for building the RESTful API. 🚀

PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing user and order data. 🗄️

AWS: Hosting and infrastructure services (e.g., EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda). ☁️

Docker: Containerization for easier deployment and scalability. 📦

Jest: Testing framework for unit and integration tests. 🧪
